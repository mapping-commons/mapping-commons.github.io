## Welcome to Mapping Commons

Mapping Commons pulls together mappings from various sources with the goal of offering them as simple to read, well provenanced TSV files in the [SSSOM format](https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/blob/master/SSSOM.md). At first, the effort will focus on biomedical ontologies and controlled vocabularies, see for example the [Mouse-Human Ontology Mapping Effort](https://github.com/mapping-commons/mh_mapping_initiative). The initiative was founded early 2021.
